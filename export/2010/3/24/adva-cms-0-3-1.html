A lot of small things have changed in adva_cms since 0.3.0!

</p>

<p>

First and most visibly, two plugins have been added and one engine got

transformed into a plugin.  But there are many fixes and tweaks that make

adva_cms better.

A lot of small things have changed in adva_cms since 0.3.0!

</p>

<p>

First and most visibly, two plugins have been added and one engine got

transformed into a plugin.  But there are many fixes and tweaks that make

adva_cms better.

</p>

<p>

A while ago, FCKEditor got renamed, updated and improved.  Now you can

have the newest version, the CKEditor, fully integrated into adva_cms with a

simple 

<code>rake adva:install plugin=adva_ckeditor</code>

.  If you have Adva::Assets

installed, you can upload your pictures through the editor.  However, you

can also drag and drop already uploaded images from the sidebar into your

articles.

</p>

<p>

If you want a more secure template, you can now use the safemode-plugin.

This registers "serb" as a TemplateHandler, which prevents malicious

commands from being executed inside the template.  So, if you download a

theme, just rename it from *.erb to *.serb and see if an error occurs.

Integration with Adva::Themes is still pending, but the groundwork is there.

</p>

<p>

Also new in the plugin directory is adva_contact_mails, which replaces the

engine of the same name.

</p>

<p>

Those three plugins (well, two essentially) are not nearly everything.

Every site now has a locale setting which sets the default language of the

frontend.  You can also change the language of the backend without tinkering

with the URL, just by using from a drop down.

</p>

<p>

While we're at languages and translations: The work flow of translating an

Article got improved.  After editing an article, you stay in the chosen

language.  If no language is chosen, the language of the backend is

preselected.  Of course, the same applies for creating new articles.

</p>

<p>

The blogs and categories now have auto-discovery links (aka atom feeds) by

default.

</p>

<p>

Under the hood, things also got cleaner again.  Some Dependencies have been

removed which should make the project somewhat more self-contained.  The

test suite, which reported error in some circumstances under Rails 2.3.5 now

runs seamlessly again with 2.3.4 and 2.3.5.

</p>

<p>

Cells got some attention too, so they are more robust and are integrated better with the caching.

</p>

<p>

Thanks to Joseph Ridgway, the email-notifications about newly created

articles or comments can be turned off or on, depending on your taste.

Before that, they were always enabled.

</p>

<p>

We could go on listing all the small changes and bug fixes now, instead

we just want to highlight that caching got better. Also thanks to Alan 

Gutierrez for sending a bug fix patch.

</p>

<p>

Details can be found in the changelog as usual.
