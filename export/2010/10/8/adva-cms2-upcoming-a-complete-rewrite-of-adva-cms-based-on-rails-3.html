<p>Yes, we've spent the last couple of months doing a complete overhaul of adva-cms, so complete in fact, that it's actually a brand new product, no fork, no clone, just fresh code.</p>
<p>We decided to do this because the development of Bundler and all the new features in Rails 3 offered us a good opportunity to reflect on the what we've learned from the original adva-cms and build a new, better and more modular Rails CMS framework: adva-cms2</p>
<p>What we've learned from the first version of adva-cms resulted in the following priorities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We'll focus more on framework level development. This will result in less end-user features for the forseeable future, but provide some kickass developer-targeted framework support (e.g. better caching, common helpers). The initial version will ship with just a few basic engines: adva-core, adva-cache, adva-blog, adva-static, adva-user.</li>
  <li>adva-cms2 will be based on Rails 3 engines. As such it will be composed of and distributed as Ruby Gems, making things a lot easier with Bundler managing (and potentially freezing) your dependencies.</li>
  <li>We'll ship some kickass cutting-edge developer features that you don't find in other CMSs. Such as full object-oriented templating, automatic cache invalidation, resource abstraction build on inherited_resources (but taken further) ... providing you a lot of extensibility and flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're still not exactly sure how soon the first release will be made public, but at this point we feel that it's a matter of weeks, not months ... followed by a much more streamlined and agile release cycle.</p>
<p>We're all really excited about adva-cms2. Our next blog post should be shortly before our first public release, so stay tuned!</p>
