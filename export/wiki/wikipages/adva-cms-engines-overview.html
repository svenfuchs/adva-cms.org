<h2>adva cms engines overview</h2>

<p>The adva cms plattform is implemented as a collection of separate Rails Engines.</p>

<p>The vision behind this approach is that at some point we want to be able to

install only the most basic engines and have a basic cms running. Or we’d only

install a core engine plus the wiki engine to have a wiki running. Or we’d

install several engines which then allow us to build a site complete with a

cms, blog, wiki and forum … and so on.</p>

<p>This all-engines-approach provides some great benefits. Amongst others:</p>

<ul>

<li>The whole plattform is located in the vendor directory it can be used as a foundation for custom applications that can be implemented in the app directory just like any other Rails application.</li>

<li>Code is shared amongst different engines which encourages a more consistent featureset and reduces the need to reimplement things for each of the modules again and again. </li>

</ul>

<p>E.g. if we’d wanted OpenID support for our application we could just add the functionality to the authentication engine. We don’t need to reimplement it for each of our blog, wiki, cms, ... applications. Or: it is a natural feature for a wiki to implement some kind of version-diff. Once this has been added to the content base class, it can be reused in other contexts as well (like, e.g. article versioning and activity tracking in the backend).</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of the current engines and the functionality they provide. The naming and structure of these engines will most probably change at some point in the future.</p>

<h3>adva_cms</h3>

<p>This is currently the core engine. It provides all the base classes that are necessary for building up a site with a section tree (Site, Section). It also holds common models for content management (Content, Article, Category).</p>

<p>For the frontend it provides a common BaseController (that serves the same role for the plattform as the ApplicationController does for a common Rails application) and a SectionsController.</p>

<p>For the backend it provides also a common BaseController as well as a large part of the controllers for the management of sites, sections, categories, themes and cached pages.</p>

<p>(This engine might be broken up into smaller engines like a core engine that only deals with site-related things and a cms engine.)</p>

<h3>adva_blog and adva_wiki</h3>

<p>These engines provide the Blog and Wiki section types to the plattform as well as the related controllers and views.</p>

<p>The blog engine is currently pretty rawboned because much of it’s functionality could be abstracted and moved to the base classes. Also, the Section type from adva_cms already provides an Article class which can be reused for the blog.</p>

<p>

(These things aren’t set in stone and may change as soon as good ideas are proposed. E.g. Section is both the section base class for Blog and Wiki

 <strong>and</strong>

 used as a concrete section type. It might be a good idea to have an additional concrete section type. If so, what would be a good name for that type?)

</p>

<h3>adva_user and authentication</h3>

<p>These engines are based on the authentication and authentication_ui engines and provide two user classes (User and Anonmyous) as well as the usual facilities for registration, login, reset password etc.</p>

<p>We’ve chosen this approach over restful_auth because the authentication engine is extremely flexible in that additional ways of authentication can easily be added. Also the existing facilities could be reused for a very simple cookie-bases “authentication” of anonymous users for the wiki and comments modules.</p>

<h3>adva_comments</h3>

<p>Something like a cranked up acts_as_commentable engine that provides commenting for the cms, blog and wiki sections.</p>

<h3>adva_assets</h3>

<p>This is largely what we know about assets from Mephisto. We’ve fixed the assets widget for the admin section and tweaked some minor bits but the rest largely still is the same.</p>

<h3>adva_activity</h3>

<p>We’ve separated out the ability to observe and log activities and abstracted things a bit.</p>

<h3>theme_support</h3>

<p>Provides the ability to use one or many themes for a site.</p>
