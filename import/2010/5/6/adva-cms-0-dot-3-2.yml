  title: 'adva-cms 0.3.2'
  body: |
    In a continued effort to offer regular releases of adva-cms, we're bringing this month another set of enhancements and bug fixes, and although it doesn't offer as much as the 0.3.1 release, we also haven't waited as long with this release as with the previous release.

    Under the "features" column, you can now set the locale for a site, which copies the title of new sections to all available translations so that there are no more empty section menu entries.

    We've also fully integrated safe-mode into the default templates and methods can now be disallowed.

    Besides all  of that, this month's release also has some bug fixes. If you're interested in them, feel free to check the commit log.
