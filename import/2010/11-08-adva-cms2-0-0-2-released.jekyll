title: adva-cms2 0.0.2 released.
filter: textile

Since we're working in sprints of 2 weeks we're also trying to follow a similar release cycle. This will of course mean fewer major changes, but also steadier stream of new features. To keep you all informed of the changes, we'll at least send the changelog to "mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/adva-cms, but of course if there is anything particularly noteworthy, you can always expect to find it mentioned here as well.

So, on to the changes to for this release, 0.0.2

First there were some I18n related changes: In order to keep the locale keys both "dry" and flexible we now support cascading fallbacks in views and have added a missing translation log that keeps you informed on all missing translations during test runs (cool).

Also, it is now possible to reuse and extend existing menus from other engines and we've improved category menus to now work with polymorphic 'categorizable' models. The table tree drag & drop has been fixed in the section and categories trees and it also now has a spinner again.

We've also improved the layout by including a sidebar block if it's present. Menus in general have been improved by adding missing I18n keys and changing the link order.

Finally, we've also met with Konstantin Haase, who did an RSoC project about improving ActiveSupport::Dependencies. He gave us a few hints about how to fix our 'vertical code slices' approach and thus fix the development mode, too (which is currently broken).

So, there you have it.
