    <h2>Sites and sections</h2>

    <p>A site maps to a domain name and consists of sections. Sections are

    implemented as Rails Engines and provide functionality such as blog, wiki,

    forum etc. Currently there are the section types Section, Blog, Wiki and

    Forum.</p>

    <p>

    Sections can be arranged to a tree and map to the

    <span class="caps">URL</span>

    in an intuitive way.

    Consider a section tree like:

    </p>

    <pre>+ home

    + docs

    + wiki

    + api

    + support

    + forum

    + faq

    </pre>

    <p>These sections would be accessible through the following URLs:</p>

    <pre>/

    /docs

    /docs/wiki

    /docs/api

    /support

    /support/forum

    /support/faq

    </pre>

    <p>

    The topmost section in a section tree, no matter how the rest of the

    section tree looks like, is considered the root section and always maps to the    <span class="caps">URL</span>

    </p>

    <p>The section type “Section” itself defines a type of section that can hold one or many articles but won’t provide any of the usual blog functionality like index pages, archives etc. This type of section is known from Mephisto and makes sense for simple pages or static collections of some articles.</p>

    <div class="wiki meta">

    <ul class="links">

    <li>

    <a href="/wiki/wikipages">all pages</a>

    </li>

    <li>

    <a href="/wiki">return to home</a>

    </li>

    </ul>
